    <h2 class="head">BIKING </h2>
</div>
    <p id="para">Biking is about as ideal as a cardio exercise gets. It provides a low-impact workout that also builds strong legs and improves heart health.

        Practically anyone can do it. It’s great for beginners. And you can pump up the intensity as your fitness level improves, making it a challenging workout even for advanced exercisers. Because you have the option of outdoor biking or indoor cycling, you can bike year round.
        
        If you want to bike outdoors but feel a bit unsteady, start with indoor cycling to help build some muscle strength to help stabilize you on a bike. Once you’re ready, take it outside but go slow at first.
        
        Always wear a helmet when you bike outdoors. Head injuries are one of the most common biking injuries when people skip protection.
    <br/>
<br/>
Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.

If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.

You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.</p>

    <h2 class="head"> Paragliding</h2>
    </div>
<p id="para">
    aragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

    Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

In 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a multi-cell wing type aerial device—"a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil ... More particularly the invention contemplates the provision of a wing of rectangular or other shape having a canopy or top skin and a lower spaced apart bottom skin", a governable gliding parachute with multi-cells and controls for glide.[2]


Governador Valadares, Brazil is known internationally for the World Paragliding Championships that has been held at Ibituruna Peak (1,123 m; 3,684 ft)
In 1954, Walter Neumark predicted (in an article in Flight magazine) a time when a glider pilot would be "able to launch himself by running over the edge of a cliff or down a slope ... whether on a rock-climbing holiday in Skye or skiing in the Alps."[3]

    <h3 class="head"> SURFING</h3>
</div>
    <p id="para"> Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.

    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
    
    Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand. Surfers who body board, body surf, or handboard feel more drag as they move through the water than stand up surfers do. This holds body surfers into a more turbulent part of the wave (often completely submerged by whitewater). In contrast, surfers who instead ride a hydrofoil feel substantially less drag and may ride unbroken waves in the open ocean.
    
    Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.
